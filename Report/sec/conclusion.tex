\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The pixel accuracy mentioned in the paper is 80.99\% while the proposed model has achieved 88.52\% on train set and 81.85\% on test set, outperforming the model stated in the original paper in terms of performance and efficiency (since the proposed backbone has lesser weights). Although our model has better performance metrics, we have to consider fact that our model is trained on a very small dataset which significantly increases the risk of overfitting.

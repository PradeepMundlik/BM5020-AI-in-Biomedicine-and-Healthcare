    In this project we aim to implement semantic segmentation model to help with segmentation task during Endoscopic procedure. The literature proposed a DeepLabV3+ model with Resenest101 backbone. We propose a DeepLabV3 model with MobileNetV3-Large as backbone layer which has less number of parameters and layers than Resenest101 hence improving efficiency. We have extracted images from POEM videos and annotated using Segment Anything Model \cite{sam-model}. Our proposed model aims to streamline and improve the accuracy of segmentation tasks in endoscopic procedures, potentially enhancing surgical outcomes and efficiency.
